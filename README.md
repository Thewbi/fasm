https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windbg-preview/9PGJGD53TN86?hl=en-us&gl=us&activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab

1. Installing WinDbg: https://github.com/microsoftfeedback/WinDbg-Feedback/issues/19
2. Go to: https://store.rg-adguard.net/
3. Choose productId from the drop down, then input the store product id of WinDbg which is 9pgjgd53tn86
4. Click on the tick button and give it a few seconds
5. The website should display direct download links (check that links are pointing to Microsoft servers just to be sure)
6. Download the appx file (should be the last one on the list)
7. DO NOT try to install it by running the appx file, instead, just unzip it to a folder and voil√†! your portable version of WinDbg is ready to be used. To unzip it, it is easier to change the filename to .zip
